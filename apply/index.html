        <li>Helping NASA speed up the discovery, analysis and development of aerospace systems using artificial intelligence to ultimately help combat climate change by reducing fuel burn for the aerospace industry</li>
        <li>Working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to better support veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, adopt medical innovations to improve mental health services and health outcomes, and reduce the processing time for benefits claims</li>
